Implementation notes
--------------------

Though Status has `status_error' field, it could be used with care:
"The error field in status is not needed for calls that return only
one status, such as MPI_WAIT, since that would only duplicate the
information returned by the function itself. The current design avoids
the additional overhead of setting it, in such cases. The field is
needed for calls that return multiple statuses, since each request may
have had a different failure." 
(quote from http://mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi22-report/node47.htm#Node47)

This means that, for example, during the call to MPI_Wait
implementation is free to leave this field filled with whatever
garbage got there during memory allocation. Haskell bindings are not
blanking out freshly allocated status for now either. So beware!
