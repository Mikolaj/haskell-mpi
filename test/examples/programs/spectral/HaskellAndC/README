Here we have a test case which checks whether a Haskell MPI program can
work with a C MPI program.

The test consists of two MPI processes:
   - Rank 0 sends a message of integers from 1 to 100 to Rank 1.
   - Rank 1 receives the message and squares every value.
   - Rank 1 sends the new message back to Rank 0.
   - Rank 0 receives the new message and prints its contents.

We've implemented both ranks in C and Haskell, so you can mix and match.

For example, to run with Rank 0 compiled from Haskell and Rank 1 compiled from C, try:

   mpirun -n 1 rank0H : -n 1 rank1C

All 4 combinations (of ranks * programming languages) should work.

Note that, at least for OpenMPI, you need to make sure that your Haskell program
is compiled for the same word size as the C program. If not MPI_Init fails.
This was observed on OS X. See comments in the Makefile about changing the
word size.
